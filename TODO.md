# TODO

## Must have
* Create an API, available over HTTP
* Given a movie id, allow votes to be registered for the movie (do not worry about repeat votes)
* Given a movie id, retrieve the movie name, id, number of votes and the rating from TMDb (https://www.themoviedb.org)


## Nice to have
* response time must be less than 50ms
